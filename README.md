# Web Automation with Selenium

Here, I have used Selenium to automate a website. I have completed a full checkout using Selenium.

Before running the project you need to add these three dependencies in your IDE: 
1. Selenium Java
2. WebDriverManager
3. TestNG

To add the dependencies, just copy the codes from [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) website and paste them into the pom.xml file.
